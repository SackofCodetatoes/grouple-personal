# Grouple

## Background and Overview
Grouple is a web application that allows for like-minded Reddit users to chat with other Redditors about their subject -subreddit- of choice.

## Functionality and MVP

- [ ] Reddit users are able to sign in through Reddit's OAuth and access the app directly
- [ ] Information such as a user's subscribed subreddits and accumuluated karma in a specific subreddit will be requested directly from the Reddit API
- [ ] Direct messages in a chatroom will have a single-depth response thread
- [ ] Guests will be able to view a subreddit's chatroom, but will not be able to participate until authenticated
- [ ] User profiles and statistics will be generated from user data requests to the API
- [ ] User location and timezone will optionally be available for other users to view

### Bonus

- [ ] Lazy loading chatroom messages for a smooth user experience and to reduce unnecessary requests
- [ ] Karma related rewards such as avatar and profile borders
- [ ] Proximity chat to contact other like-minded Redditors around you
